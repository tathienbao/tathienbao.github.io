# Personal Profile Page with GraphQL and SVG

This project is a simple personal profile page that utilizes GraphQL for data fetching and SVG for data visualization.

## Overview

The personal profile page provides a visual representation of a user's experience points (XP) over time, as well as other personal details. The data is fetched from a GraphQL API, which allows for efficient and flexible data retrieval. The XP data is then visualized using SVG, providing a clear and interactive view of the user's progress.

## Features

- **User Information Display**: The page displays various pieces of user information, such as name, email, and campus.
- **XP Visualization**: The user's XP is visualized over time using an SVG-based timeline. Each XP transaction is represented as a dot on the timeline, with the vertical position of the dot corresponding to the amount of XP.
- **Responsive Design**: The page layout adjusts to fit different screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **GraphQL**: Used for efficient and flexible data fetching from the backend API. GraphQL queries are used to retrieve only the necessary data, reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network and improving performance.
- **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)**: Used for data visualization. SVG is a vector-based graphics format that allows for high-quality, interactive graphics that scale well to different screen sizes.
